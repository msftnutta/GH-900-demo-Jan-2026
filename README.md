### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- GitHub account
- Basic command line knowledge
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/GH-900-demo-Jan-2026.git
   cd GH-900-demo-Jan-2026
   ```

2. **Configure Git**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

## 📚 GitHub Features Covered

### 1. Repository Basics

- **Creating repositories**: Public vs. Private
- **README.md**: Documentation best practices
- **LICENSE**: Choosing the right license
- **.gitignore**: Excluding files from version control
- **Repository settings**: Managing access and features

### 2. Issues

Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs.

**Creating an Issue:**
1. Navigate to the "Issues" tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Provide a descriptive title
4. Add details in the description
5. Assign labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
6. Assign to team members
7. Link to projects or milestones

**Best Practices:**
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Provide reproduction steps for bugs
- Add relevant labels
- Reference related issues using `#issue-number`
- Close issues with commit messages: `Fixes #123`

### 3. Branches

Branches allow you to develop features isolated from the main codebase.

**Common Branching Strategy:**
```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/add-login
│   ├── feature/user-dashboard
│   └── bugfix/fix-typo
```

**Working with Branches:**

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# List all branches
git branch -a

# Switch to a branch
git checkout branch-name

# Push branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Delete a branch (local)
git branch -d branch-name

# Delete a branch (remote)
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`)
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`)
- `hotfix/` - Urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)

### 4. Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch.

**Creating a Pull Request:**

1. Push your branch to GitHub
2. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
3. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
4. Select base branch (usually `main`) and compare branch (your feature branch)
5. Add a descriptive title and detailed description
6. Request reviewers
7. Add labels and link related issues
8. Create the pull request

**PR Description Template:**

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Refactoring

## Related Issues
Fixes #123

## Changes Made
- Added feature X
- Updated component Y
- Fixed bug in Z

## Testing
- [ ] Tested locally
- [ ] Added unit tests
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if applicable)
[Add screenshots here]

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-reviewed the code
- [ ] Commented code where necessary
- [ ] Updated documentation
```

**PR Review Process:**
1. Reviewer examines code changes
2. Leaves comments on specific lines
3. Requests changes or approves
4. Author addresses feedback
5. Re-review if needed
6. Merge when approved

**Merging Strategies:**
- **Merge commit**: Preserves all commits and creates a merge commit
- **Squash and merge**: Combines all commits into one
- **Rebase and merge**: Replays commits on top of base branch

### 5. Code Review

**As a Reviewer:**
- Be constructive and respectful
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Approve when satisfied or request changes
- Use GitHub suggestions for quick fixes

**As an Author:**
- Respond to all comments
- Make requested changes promptly
- Mark conversations as resolved
- Keep PRs small and focused

### 6. Collaboration Workflow

**Standard Git Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature description"

# 4. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub

# 6. After PR is merged, update local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 7. Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/my-feature
```

**Commit Message Best Practices:**
```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
git commit -m "Fix login button alignment issue"
git commit -m "Update README with setup instructions"

# Use conventional commits format
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in dashboard"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify authentication logic"
```

### 7. GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects help organize and prioritize work.

**Setting up a Project:**
1. Go to "Projects" tab
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose template (Board, Table, etc.)
4. Add columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
5. Link issues and pull requests

### 8. Labels & Milestones

**Common Labels:**
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed
- `priority: high` - High priority items

**Using Milestones:**
- Group issues and PRs
- Track progress toward goals
- Set due dates
- Plan releases

### 9. Markdown Formatting

GitHub uses Markdown for formatting text.

**Common Syntax:**

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**bold text**
*italic text*
~~strikethrough~~

- Unordered list item
- Another item

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Image alt text](image-url.jpg)

`inline code`

```code block```

> Blockquote

| Table | Header |
|-------|--------|
| Cell  | Cell   |

- [ ] Task list item
- [x] Completed task
```

### 10. GitHub CLI (gh)

The GitHub CLI brings GitHub to your terminal.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Windows (using winget)
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Mac (using Homebrew)
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# Create a repository
gh repo create my-project --public

# Clone a repository
gh repo clone owner/repo

# Create an issue
gh issue create --title "Bug report" --body "Description"

# List issues
gh issue list

# Create a pull request
gh pr create --title "Add feature" --body "Description"

# Check out a pull request
gh pr checkout 123

# Merge a pull request
gh pr merge 123

# View PR status
gh pr status
```
